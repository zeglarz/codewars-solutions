/*
Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result.

It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b.

arrayDiff([1,2],[1]) == [2]
If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the otÂ£her:

arrayDiff([1,2,2,2,3],[2]) == [1,3]
 */

const arrayDiff = (a, b) => a.filter(x => !b.includes(x));

console.log(arrayDiff([1, 2, 2, 2, 3], [2]));

module.exports = arrayDiff;
